/Write a c program to print all those numbers from 1 upto n which are divisible by k and also print evensum and oddsum from those divisible.

	printf(" Enter n value:");
	scanf("%d",&n);
	printf(" The number is divisible by");
	scanf("%d",&d);
	for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
	{

		printf(" %d \n",i);
	}
	if(i%n==0)

	printf(" The sum of Even numbers: %d",EvenSum);
	else
	OddSum=OddSum+i;
	printf(" The sum of Odd Numbers: %d",OddSum);
